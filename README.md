### 🌟 Overview

Manual creation of university class schedules is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when balancing teacher availability, room assignments, and fixed General Education (GED) slots.  
**ClassMate** automates this process using a greedy algorithm to produce conflict-free weekly routines, with an admin interface for tweaks and OTP-secure login for users.

---

### 🚀 Features

- **Automated routine generation** using a greedy algorithm to allocate time-slots without conflicts.  
- **Input via Excel**:  
  1. Course distribution (teacher assignments + day-offs)  
  2. Room availability  
  3. Fixed GED schedule  
  4. Batch & section info  
- **Admin panel** to review and manually adjust schedules.  
- **Teacher & student views** with weekly routine and class reminders.  
- **Secure OTP-based login** to protect data.  
- **Real-time backend** powered by Firebase.

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (frontend)  
- **Dart** (business logic & greedy algorithm)  
- **Firebase** (realtime database, authentication)  
- **Excel file processing** for bulk input handling

---

### 👻 Usage

1. **Admin** uploads the four Excel input files via the “Upload Data” screen.  
2. Tap **Generate Routine** to run the greedy-algorithm scheduler.  
3. Review the auto-generated timetable; drag-and-drop to resolve any edge-case conflicts.  
4. **Teachers/Students** log in via OTP to view their personalized weekly schedule and receive reminders.

### ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

- Currently tailored to CSE Department, Leading University. Porting requires re-configuring constraints.  
- Requires stable internet (Firebase-backed).  
- Edge-case room/teacher changes may need manual fixes.  

**Planned enhancements:**  
- Scalability across departments/institutions  
- Offline mode for schedule viewing  
- Exam scheduling, AI-based optimization  
- Deeper integration with university MIS & push-notifications
